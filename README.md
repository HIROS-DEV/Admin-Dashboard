# Project: Admin Dashboard OverView

The project is for Intermediate HTML and CSS Course of the Odin Project(URL:https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard#assignment).

(The Odin Project is the free course to become a fullstack web developer)

In this lesson, I had to create a  Admin Dashboard using HTML and CSS (Especially,the project is for learning Grid)

# Web URL

Web Page: https://hiros-dev.github.io/Admin-Dashboard/

(This is not a responsive site. So, if you watch the site in smart phone display, page's layout would break. I recommend you should use Desktop PC)

# What did I learn through this course

I could practice some basic CSS technics to create web site.

Especially, Grid and FlexBox, and how to align items in the web site.

Additionally, I got a knowledge of general web page's layout.

# Assets

In this project, I used some icons, avatar mockup images, and font.
I got these assets from the following sites. (all free)

Roboto Font: Google Fonts(https://fonts.google.com/)
Icons: Material Design Icons (https://materialdesignicons.com/)
Avatar Image: avataaars generator(https://getavataaars.com/)

# Summary

I think Grid is very powerful tool for the web page's layout.
But, it is not easy.

Sadly, I can not use Grid perfectly at the current time.
Probably, I should use Grid in the future's project and I should get used to it more.

But, as of today, I am very satisfied with my project!!

Thank you for reading.
And, happy coding!!!
