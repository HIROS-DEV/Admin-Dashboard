TODO:1 At first, I should create overall layout of HTML. The page layout is a grid(I think I should use grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr))

TODO:2 My grid-column has 4 column. And first column is for Dashboard. From second to four columns is for Header and Main-contents.

TODO:3 If you finish to create overall layout, I should create Nesting components.
At first, I have to create Sidebar. I think I can create using flexbox and flex-direction:column. But project instruction says to use Grid. So, I am going to obey it.(I think I have to use ul/li. grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)?)

TODO:4 I should create header section. I think this section can create using flexbox. But I have to use Grid.(I think grid needs to 5 columns and 2 rows. And, second column is 1fr. Another columns is prefixed width or min-content? First row is 1fr. Second row is 2fr?)

TODO:5 Download fonts(From Google fonts and uses Roboto) and Icons(Material Design Icons)

TODO:6 Create Cards section. I think I should use grid-template-columns: 3 or repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)). grid-template-rows: repeat(12, 1fr)?

<!-- If I finish the each section, I should git add / git commit / git push -->
